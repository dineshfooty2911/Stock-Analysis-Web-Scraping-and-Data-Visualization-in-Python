# Stock Analysis with Web Scraping and Data Visualization in Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis of stock prices, leveraging web scraping techniques to extract data and using Python for visualization. The analysis targets stock price data for major banks, offering insights into trends and risk assessments over a specific period.

## Technology Stack
- **Pandas DataReader**: Used to fetch financial data directly from the internet.
- **Seaborn**: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphs.
- **Matplotlib**: For crafting static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

## Data Collection
The stock price data for several major banks, including Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo, is sourced from Stooq via Pandas DataReader. The data spans from January 2006 to January 2016, capturing a significant period for analysis.

## Features of the Project
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representations of data are used extensively throughout the project to analyze trends and relationships between different variables.
- **Risk Analysis**: The project assesses the risk profiles of different banks based on the standard deviation of their stock returns.
- **Trend Analysis**: Examines the overall performance of bank stocks over a decade, identifying key trends and patterns.

### Key Visualizations
- **Pair Plot**: Explores correlations and distributions of daily returns among all banks simultaneously.
- **Distribution Plots**: Analyzes the distribution of stock returns for specific years, highlighting periods of high volatility.
- **Line Plots**: Tracks the closing price of each bank's stock over time, providing a visual history of stock performance.

### Advanced Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilizes Plotly and Cufflinks to enhance the interactivity of plots, allowing for a more dynamic exploration of the data.

## Impact
This project provides valuable insights into the financial stability and performance trends of some of the largest banking institutions. It serves as a practical demonstration of how Python can be used for effective financial analysis, making it a useful reference for individuals interested in finance, data analysis, or data science.

## Conclusion
The analysis showcases the utility of Python in financial analysis, providing a comprehensive toolkit for scraping, processing, and visualizing stock data. This project can be particularly useful for financial analysts, data scientists, and anyone interested in the dynamics of the stock market.
